# confinement
energy-confinement model for I-mode data -- generate ITER89/ITER98-like 
power-law models for I-mode energy confinement time.

Working routines are contained in the "scaling" python package.

Other routines callout to scaling scripts, running regression on parameter 
sets and displaying the result.  tauE_convert.py is a quick script to recast 
the result to dimensionless parameters.
